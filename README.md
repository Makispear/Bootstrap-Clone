## Why Bootstrap?
This project is just an example of how you can create a fully designed website entirely With Bootstrap. It has components you can use like alerts, badges, cards, modals, and more. If you want a website for your mobile, Bootstrap has built-in responsiveness, so you don't have to worry about whether your clients are browsing from an iPhone 5, a tablet, or a big monitor. With a few custom styles as possible needed, you can make your website in no time!
